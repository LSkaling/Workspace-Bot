# Workspace Bot
Workspace bot provides an intuitive way to mange SSI's workspace. It integrates with Slack and provides slash commands for reporting workspace issues and logging workspace cleanings. This has been developed in an effort to improve workspace cleanliness by requiring workspace cleanings by all members.
